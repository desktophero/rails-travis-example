# Battle-tested Code without the Battle 
Welcome to the Velocity 2014 Tutorial: Battle-tested Code Without the Battle--Security Testing and Continuous Integration.  For this workshop we will be working on two different Continuous Integration systems to show how to integrate security testing in a CI/CD environment. For the first half of the workshop we will be using Travis CI and for the second half of the workshop we will be using Jenkins. 

## Requirements
* You need a Github account, if you dont have an account, [create one now.](https://github.com/join)
* A Travis CI account, if you dont have one, [create one now.](https://travis-ci.org)

## Goals of the Tutorial
* Understanding of the types of securtiy testing that are available
* Sample attacks and tests that can be reused in your organization
* A sample CI implementation you can reference later
* Introduction to the [Secure Pipeline project](https:github.com/secure-piepeline/secure-pipeline) and how you can get involved

# LAB 0
* Make sure you can have an account with Github and Travis CI.
* Go to [https://github.com/secure-pipeline/rails-travis-example](https://github.com/secure-pipeline/rails-travis-example) and fork the repo.
* Read [lab_0/.travis.yml](https://github.com/secure-pipeline/rails-travis-example/blob/master/velocity/lab_0/.travis.yml) and meditate on the truth therein.
* Thats it.
